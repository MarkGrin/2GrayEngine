1.General structure

All code is separated in modules. Every module has it own folder. Every module
has core.h file. The main file is main.cpp. It is including core.h that is
including core.h.

Example

                                                 | --> dataBase/base.h
 standard library         |--> dataBase/core.h --| --> dataBase/rows.h
       ^                  |                      | --> dataBase/lines.h
       |                  |                      
       |                  |                      | --> network/send.h
    main.cpp --> core.h --|--> network/core.h ---| --> network/receive.h
                          |                      | --> network/interface.h
                          |
                          |                      | --> engine/compile.h
                          |--> engine/core.h ----| --> engine/constants.h
                                                 | --> engine/run.h


2.Namespace protection

Every module must be protected by a namespace. Every list of varibles like
error codes must be protected by a namespace too.


3.Classes

Classes are made of two files. ClassName.h and ClassNameMethods.h.
Example
socket.h
socketMethods.h
First has the prototype of the class and second file has bodies of all
methods.


4.Module cores

Module core is a file that includes all files of a core. First it declares
all classes that are in core. Then it include files settings files and
different enums and lists. Then it includes all method files. Then it
includes classes and their method files.
