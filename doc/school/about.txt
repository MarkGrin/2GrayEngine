School module is a project that was given as a task in school. It requires
implementation of:

*Lexical analysis                          \
*Syntax analysis resulting AST tree        | - compilation
*AST to engine executable code translation /

*Engine executable code execution | - execution

To achive this goal in school module will be implemented new method of
compilation as it was asked to do in school. After this method is
added to engine module and execution is tweaked to be able to execute
all things that were added as school task, school task will be finished
and project will gain new more professional compilation method.

When school task is completed and submited to school AST tree and executor
will probably will be changed a little to remove specific school task
details that are irrelevant to project.

After this plan is done module will be deleted and probably will have
very small trace somwhere in backlog.

In the std_notes.txt described notes about AST standard to discuss with classmates.

Current status:AST tree - implementation
