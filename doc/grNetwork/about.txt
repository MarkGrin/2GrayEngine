grNetwork module contains two interfaces that are wappers over standard windows
sockets.

ErrorList.h file is file that contains list of all errors that can happen
when using this module.

Socket data structure contains fields that are often used when working
with windows sockets. They were placed in this structure for comfort.

ErrorInfo class is a class that describes error. It has two parts,
lib and local.
lib is an error code that describes what happened wrong in lib that module
uses (winsock)
local is an error code that describes what happened wrong in module itself

There are two main interfaces that use those things written higher. They
are placed in different folders.

First one is Socket. It is represented by two classes Server and Client,
and one abstract class.
Socket class has functions that are used both by Server and Client.
Server has listen function.
Client has connect function.
Server and Client are inherited from Socket class.
They are in Socket folder.
They use IPv4/TCP (IPv6 is planned but, not written).

Second one is RawSocket. It is represented by RawSocket class.
It uses IPv4 protocol (IPv6 is planned but, not written). When using
RawSocket you can set it up for custom header, so you can build IPv4 header
yourself.
