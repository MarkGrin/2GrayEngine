debug module is module that works error and debug flow.

there are three kinds of debug info.

errors - general errors, usually user needs them to understand what went wrong,
example "Cant find file"

internal - errors deep in programm, usually developer needs them to understand
what caused unknown error, example "empty functions stack on line 123 file
main.cpp"

debug - debug messages that developer uses only in development, example
"before crash stack size is:23"

These three kind of function have report functions like
OUTPUT_DEBUG, OUTPUT_ERROR, OUTPUT_INTERNAL.

if ALLOW_OUTPUT_## is defined, than programm will output them, if not defined
OUTPUT_## calls will be deleted from programm by preprocessor.

if DEBUG::OUTPUT_##_FILE is pointing at some string, this string will be used
as name of the file to put errors in. If it is set to nullptr ouptut will
print messages by printf function.

Another feature is custom debug which means that you can create your own type
of debug and use like DEBUG, INTERNAL and others.
