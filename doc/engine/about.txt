Engine module is the module that runs scripts. Scripts can be inputted through
the command line, network, gui, file or programmly.

All the scripts are made of varibles and functions. There are some standard
types of varibles, but most of them are imported fromm dll. Functions are
imported from dll too. They are standard functions too.

There are methods that extracts functions from dll. Every dll that interacts
with engine must have three function.
First is: TechnicalData getTechnicalData ();
It returns TechnicalData about dll.
Second is: vector<typeAttributes*>* getTypes ();
It returns all custom types.
Third is: vector<functionAttributes*>* getFunctions ();
It returns all custom functions from dll.

After types and functions are extracted the can be used in programm. Function
attribute describes types that it needs as arguments and of course it has
the function.

Script is given to the ScriptHolder line by line by special string interface.
By default string interface is command line -> scriptHolder. But there are
functions that can change the type of input. After ScriptHolder has whole
script executer starts to execute it. Usually it does it line by line, but
sometimes it can return to previous lines. Thanks to ScriptHolder.

Executer has methods that interpetate script in what to do commands.
Every line is a call of some function. Even creating a varible is a function.
So executer gets the name of function. It looks is there a function that is
called as in the script. If there is, it look are there varibles that are
called same as arguments of function in script. If there are, it checks 
if function arguments types match types of varibles that executer has.

So engine doesn't do anything really. It just gives functions the varibles
they need.
