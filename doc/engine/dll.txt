user can import their own functions and types by dll.

function and types are classes that user must write.

to import function user must write class and inherit it from engine::Function
class. User must overload two virtual functions attributes and
payLoadFunction. attrributes function must return valid functionAttributes
function. payLoadFunction must do what user want his function to do when other
users call his function. He can retreive arguments with popArg function.

to import type user must write class and inherit it from engine::Object, he
also must create typeAttributes structure and fill it with valid data.

when it all is done, he must write three functions.

technicalData* data (); - that will return pointer to technicalData that was
filled with valid information.

std::vector<Functions*>* funcs (); that will return vector of pointers to
user created functions.

std::vector<typeAttributes>* types (); that will return vector of pointers to
typeAttributes structure that was filled with valid information.
