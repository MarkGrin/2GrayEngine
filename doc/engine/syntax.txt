engine executes two types of commands. User commands and system commands.

system commands starts with ! sign.

system commands are

!new Type VaribleName
example
!new Text txt

this command adds new varible named VaribleName with type Type. And calls
it constructor.Given type must be known by engine. Given name must be free.


!delete VaribleName
example
!delete txt

this command deletes varible and calls it destructor.


other commands are user commands. Some are imported from dll other are
standard. To read about standard commands read standard.txt

to call user function use this syntax

userCommandName param1 param2 param3


Also in engine there are returning values and cycles and conditionals, but
they aren't developed yet.


Usually user writes script in file and then calls programm to execute this
file, but also there are other input methods. If you call programm with
-d flag. It will start dynamic mode. In dynamic mode it executes one function
at time. Also in dynamic mode you can mark file to be executed or even
get script from inernet.
