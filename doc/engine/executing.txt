This engine is translator. So running file is divided in two parts,
compilation and executing. In code there are three files.

run.h, compile.h, execute.h

run.h file is main file it calls compile function and then execute function.

there is environment structure which contains varibleList, typeList,
scriptHolder, functionList, etc.

compile function from compile.h file fills this environment and execute
function from execute.h file uses this environment.
